The \u0022Bedtime\u0022 and \u0022Wakeup time\u0022 features indicate when each subject goes to bed and wakes up each day, and the \u0022Sleep duration\u0022 feature records the total amount of time each subject slept in hours. The \u0022Sleep efficiency\u0022 feature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is actually spent asleep. The \u0022REM sleep percentage\u0022, \u0022Deep sleep percentage\u0022, and \u0022Light sleep percentage\u0022 features indicate the amount of time each subject spent in each stage of sleep. The \u0022Awakenings\u0022 feature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the night. Additionally, the dataset includes information about each subject\u0027s caffeine and alcohol consumption in the 24 hours prior to bedtime, their smoking status, and their exercise frequency."}
